shop easy betting system
	horse and dog racing
	sports betting
	new domain that shows all odds
	customer prepares a temp coupon on their own phone/kiosk
		customer can set minimum rates for each choice or the total coupon rate
		if any rates fall below the minimum at the time of payment then the operator is alerted and additional confirmation is required from customer
	customer is given a 6-digit xxx-xxx numeric code or barcorde or qr code for depositing bet in the shop
	shop operator takes the money and finalizes the coupon, gives customer a regular coupon printout or the customer can view the finalized bet on their phone
		no printout option for live betting since the deposit delay will slow things down too much
		user can check the status of their bet through their phone using the qr code
		or if the user adds their phone number to the coupon we can send them an approved/rejected coupon link
	this forms the basis of the new website
		mobile friendly and without rng games in the beginning
		at later stages add in the old games
		then rip from another source and add in live casino games
